# Assignment 24

For this assignment you will make one static method called `biggestDiff` and test it in `main`.

## Specifications

Given a String length 1 or more of just integers, return the difference between the largest and smallest values in the String. You can assume there will be no negatives.

A few notes: 

* Use `nextLine()` to get use input for the String of ints.

* `Integer.parseInt(String s)` will return a copy of the String converted to an int.

* The built-in `Math.min(int v1, int v2)` and `Math.max(int v1, int v2)` methods return the smaller or larger of two values, but you do not need to use this and can just use if statements if you'd like.

### Sample Outputs

```
Enter the string: 288321
Biggest difference: 7
```

```
Enter the string: 2063340
Biggest difference: 6
```

### Grading

As always, your program will be graded on its functionality according to the project specifications and proper code style.
